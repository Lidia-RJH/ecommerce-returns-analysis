# SuperStore - Returns and Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
After thoroughly examining the Superstore's purchase and return data through Tableau Visualizations, I identified several potential factors contributing to high return rates, and proposes recommendations to reduce the volume of returned products. 

This was an independent project part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence Curriculum where I explored the implementation of Visualizations for data storytelling in a business setting.

## Data
Dataset with information about sales and returns or an e-commerce store provided by TripleTen. 
* `Superstore.xls`: contains records for each product sold. 
    * `Orders sheet`: information about each sale. 
    * `Returns sheet`: information about each returned item. 


## Description
* I built a 14-page Tableau project including 9 individual visualizations, 4 dashboards, and a Story (presentation).
* In this project you'll find: data analysis and metrics comparison, findings, and business recommendations. 

## Assumptions
- Return rates are growing, generating negative sales.
- Some regions present higher return rates. 
- There are several root causes behind high return rates.
- The implementation of new strategies in the Marketing and Operations departments is needed.

## Process
- Using the Superstore dataset, I joined the sales and return worksheets in Tableau. 
- Created calculated fields to gather information on return count and return rate. 
- Analyze the data through visualization and the comparison of single and multiple measures and dimensions to find trends. 
- Built dashboards to group visualizations and convey the information so it's easy to understand. 
- Implemented Year(Order Data) filter across dashboards to create an interactive experience and a more granular presentation of the data. 
- Created a Tableau story to present my findings. 

## Findings 
1. The increase in returns is generating losses in profits. 
2. Higher return rates are more heavily concentrated in Western states. 
3. Binders present a high return rate. 
4. Orders with a "Same-Day" delivery present the highest return rate and lower total order count. This could be due to impulse purchase and seasonality. 
5. Orders made through Fall have a high return rate. 
6. There are customers with a 100% return rate. 
7. Most returns come from customers in the consumer segment.
8. Some products with higher discounts present a higher return rate. 

## Recommendations
1. Review the quality of products and audience needs in areas with higher return rates. 
2. Re-evaluate discount frequency and strategy for product categories with high returns and high discounts. 
3. Gather user feedback on products like Copiers where returns are high despite low discounts.
